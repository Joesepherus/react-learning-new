<ul>
  <li>Setting state requests a new render.</li>
  <li>React stores state outside of your component, as if on a shelf.</li>
  <li>
    When you call useState, React gives you a snapshot of the state for that
    render.
  </li>
  <li>
    Variables and event handlers don’t “survive” re-renders. Every render has
    its own event handlers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every render (and functions inside it) will always “see” the snapshot of the
    state that React gave to that render.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can mentally substitute state in event handlers, similarly to how you
    think about the rendered JSX.
  </li>
  <li>
    Event handlers created in the past have the state values from the render in
    which they were created.
  </li>
</ul>
