<div>
  Don’t try to “change props”. When you need to respond to the user input (like
  changing the selected color), you will need to “set state”,
</div>
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>
      To pass props, add them to the JSX, just like you would with HTML
      attributes.
    </li>
    <li>
      To read props, use the function Avatar({ person, size }) destructuring
      syntax.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can specify a default value like size = 100, which is used for missing
      and undefined props.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can forward all props with <Avatar {...props} /> JSX spread syntax,
      but don’t overuse it!
    </li>
    <li>
      Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s
      children prop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version
      of props.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set
      state.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
