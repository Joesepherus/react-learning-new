    Custom Hooks let you share stateful logic but not state itself. Each call to
    a Hook is completely independent from every other call to the same Hook.
  </div>
  <div>
    When you need to share the state itself between multiple components, lift it
    up and pass it down instead.
  </div>
  <div>
    The code inside your custom Hooks will re-run during every re-render of your
    component. This is why, like components, custom Hooks need to be pure. Think
    of custom Hooks’ code as part of your component’s body!
  </div>
  <div>
    You don’t need to extract a custom Hook for every little duplicated bit of
    code. Some duplication is fine. For example, extracting a useFormInput Hook
    to wrap a single useState call like earlier is probably unnecessary.
  </div>
  <div>
    However, whenever you write an Effect, consider whether it would be clearer
    to also wrap it in a custom Hook. You shouldn’t need Effects very often, so
    if you’re writing one, it means that you need to “step outside React” to
    synchronize with some external system or to do something that React doesn’t
    have a built-in API for. Wrapping it into a custom Hook lets you precisely
    communicate your intent and how the data flows through it.
  </div>
  <div>
    A good custom Hook makes the calling code more declarative by constraining
    what it does.
  </div>
  <div>
    If your custom Hook API doesn’t constrain the use cases and is very
    abstract, in the long run it’s likely to introduce more problems than it
    solves.

    <ul>
      <li>Custom Hooks let you share logic between components.</li>
      <li>
        Custom Hooks must be named starting with use followed by a capital
        letter.
      </li>
      <li>Custom Hooks only share stateful logic, not state itself.</li>
      <li>
        You can pass reactive values from one Hook to another, and they stay
        up-to-date.
      </li>
      <li>All Hooks re-run every time your component re-renders.</li>
      <li>
        The code of your custom Hooks should be pure, like your component’s
        code.
      </li>
      <li>Wrap event handlers received by custom Hooks into Effect Events.</li>
      <li>
        Don’t create custom Hooks like useMount. Keep their purpose specific.
      </li>
      <li>
        It’s up to you how and where to choose the boundaries of your code.
      </li>
